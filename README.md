# 2021 SCIM Interest Group
The 2021 SCIM interest group is an informal meeting of technologists interested in understanding and furthering the future of the SCIM Specification, today known as IETF RFC 7642, 7643 and 7644.  For a quick overview of what SCIM does, see [About SCIM](#about-scim)

## Meetings and Agenda 


## About SCIM
### Purpose
SCIM - System for Cross-Domain Identity Management is a standardized REST API for managing common identity objects, including users and groups. Most applications need to manage users and groups - adding new users, changing their permissions and attributes, moving users into and out of groups, and managing the groups themselves. When viewed as a standalone problem, it doesn't seem like a big deal for a developer to make their own API to do these things, however when you switch the perspective to the IT department of an organization that might manage hundreds or thousands of applications, the problem of bespoke user creation becomes an obvious and terrible problem.  The goal of SCIM is to make it possible for an application to quickly and easily become part of an Identity Management orchestration effort. Rather than requiring expensive and painful proprietary connectors between every platform that might wish to automate identity activities and every application that customers wish to automate, SCIM enables a write-once, use everywhere philosophy.  

### Standards Body History
  SCIM 2.0 was ratified in IETF in 2015, publishing the following specifications:
 * [RFC 7642 - Definitions, Overview, Concepts, and Requirements](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7642)
 * [RFC 7643 - Core Schema](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643)
 * [RFC 7644 - Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644)
