# SCIM Industry Next Steps (sins)

The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
is an HTTP-based protocol that makes managing identities in multi-domain scenarios easier. SCIM was last published in 2015 and has seen growing adoption.

One goal for this working group is to shepherd SCIM, currently RFC series [7642](https://https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7642), [7643](https://https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643), [7644](https://https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644), through the Internet Standard process. The group will deliver revised specifications for the SCIM requirements as Informational, and for the SCIM protocol and base schema suitable for consideration as a Standard. This work will be based upon the existing RFCs, errata and interoperabilty feedback, and incorporate current security and privacy best practices.

In addition to revising the requirements, protocol and base schema RFCs, the group will also consider additional specifications as extensions to SCIM that have found broad adoption and are ready for standards track.  This includes profiles and schemas for interoperability in additional scenarios.  The working group will publish Proposed Standard RFCs for:

* Handling returning large result sets through paging, based on [draft-hunt-scim-mv-paging-00](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-hunt-scim-mv-paging-00.html)	and [draft-peterson-scim-cursor-pagination-00](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-peterson-scim-cursor-pagination-00)
* Schema for exchanging HR information through SCIM use case
* Schema for exchanging Enterprise group information through SCIM case
* Schema for Privileged Access Management through SCIM use case, based on [draft-grizzle-scim-pam-ext-01](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-grizzle-scim-pam-ext-01)
* Handling Deletes in SCIM Servers that don't allow Deletes (Soft Deletes) - based on [draft-ansari-scim-soft-delete-00](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ansari-scim-soft-delete-00)
* Profiling SCIM relationship with Single Sign On (SSO) protocols
