## Overview
For the last several months, company and individual representatives interested in moving the SCIM 2.0 Specification Family (RFC series ([7642](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7642), [7643](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643), [7644](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644))) forward have been meeting to discuss implementation experiences, review draft proposals that have expired, and to talk about the paper cuts many in the identity world feel could be improved by revisiting SCIM as a protocol and schema.
