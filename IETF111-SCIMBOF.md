# IETF 111 BOF Agenda
Status of BOF proposal:  not yet accepted
Name of session:  SCIM Industry Next Steps
Requested length:  1 hour

## Overview
For the last several months, company and individual representatives interested in moving the SCIM 2.0 Specification (RFCs 7642,43 and 44) have been meeting to discuss implementation experiences, review draft proposals that have expired, and to talk about the paper cuts many in the identity world feel could be improved by revisiting SCIM as a protocol and schema.

## Why an IETF BOF?
While it is true that the original SCIM working group is long gone, IETF continues to be the central community for scim discussion via the still existing SCIM mailing list.  We are looking for feedback from the wider IETF community in addition to the identity experts that regularly attend our interest group meetings around whether it makes sense to recharter a new effort around the SCIM family. 


## Topics for Consideration
Topics listed so far for consideration:
* Paper cuts (20 min):  What do implementers today find good and bad about SCIM 2.0
* Draft review (20 min):  What expired drafts are relevant today and how could they be improved 
* New work:  (20 min) A small presentation on new work, for feedback from the larger group
